      <h2>This Is My First Article</h2>
      <p class="firstParagraph">Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! I'm a thing. I'll get my kit! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Why not indeed!</p>
      <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Why would a robot need to drink? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
      <p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Ummm…to eBay?</p>

      <h2>This Is Another Article</h2>
      <p class="firstParagraph">I had more, but you go ahead. Kids have names? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I love you, buddy! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
      <p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>
      <p>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Why not indeed! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
